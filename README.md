--STATUS UPDATES--

Status 4 (12:46 2-7-20): First Indev release!
The first Indev release for the mod has been released! The mod is not in a playable state but you can see what changes the mod makes so far. Just download it at HOI4-The Old Order Indev 1(1211 2-7-20).zip from the repo

Status 3 (10:56 2-7-20): Idiocracy 
I AM AN IDIOT! So I set the captitals of each country to PROVINICES! not states. So it works now. I have still set up Prussia as a seperate country, after borders are done I will probably release a demo.

Status 2 (22:09 2-6-20): Fixing Prussia:

Well i have no idea whats wrong with Prussia. I am making Prussia a compleaty new country which will hopfully fix this crap. This will take a sec but should fix the mod. I will post a status update when its finished or if something big happens. 

Status 1 (2-5-20) Work so far:
Right now the mod has Bavaria, Saxony, Brandenburg, and Berlin with there (asof now) correct borders.

There is also Prussia who is in the game but not with final borders

Prussia has flags for all ideologys and all above countries have colors

The mod is currently broken and freezes when loading history files after selecting a country
